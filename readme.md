# Lan History Manager

This application runs in the Windows 10 task tray, and makes it easier to use
Windows File History when backing up to a file share. Currently only the 64 bit
version of Windows 10 is supported.

You can find documentation on how to use the app at http://jumpforjoysoftware.com/lan-history-manager/.
